# Tensorflow Tutorials

Bare bones introduction to machine learning from linear regression to convolutional neural networks using Tensorflow.
This code is a reimplementation of an [excellent tutorial](https://github.com/Newmu/Theano-Tutorials) for Theano by Alec Radford (highly recommended with accompanying [video talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S75EdAcXHKk)).
